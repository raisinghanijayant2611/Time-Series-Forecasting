This was the first assignment on simple smoothing and Holt Winters models. The aim is to develop an understanding of the following terms: 
	- Different ETS models (including Holt Winters') and understanding Level, Trend and Seasonality parameters in a Time Series model 
	- Understanding the ts() graphs  
	- Na√Øve Bayes and its comparisons 
	- Methods of comparison between models 
	- Real world application of such methods and evaluating the forecasts
