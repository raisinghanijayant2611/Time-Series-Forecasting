# Time-Series-Forecasting
During my  second half of the fall semester in 2019, I learnt about Time Series Forecasting and how it is applied in the daily business of Supply Chain function across industries. I also came across these models during my working experience.  

This folder contains some exercises on Forecasting Time Series data. It consists of some assignments that were given as a part of this course which ties the traditional methods with practical applications in Supply Chain functions.  It is then followed by some more models developed by me to showcase how different methods other than the traditional ones can be applied
